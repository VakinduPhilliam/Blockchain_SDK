## Installation

### Installation via npm

Add Lisk Elements as a dependency of your project:

```sh
$ npm install --save lisk-elements
```

Import using ES6 modules syntax:

```js
import lisk from 'lisk-elements';
```

Or using Node.js modules:

```js
const lisk = require('lisk-elements');
```

Or import specific namespaced functionality:

```js
import { APIClient, transactions } from 'lisk-elements';
// or
const { APIClient, transactions } = require('lisk-elements');
```

**Note:** If you are installing Lisk Elements as an npm dependency via a GitHub reference, you will need to manually build the distribution files by running the following commands from the root directory of your project:

```
cd node_modules/lisk-elements
npm run build
```

### Installation from source

Our source code is hosted on GitHub. You can build the distribution yourself by cloning the repository, installing the relevant dependencies and running our build script as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-elements.git
cd lisk-elements/packages/lisk-elements
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

Access functionality via the relevant namespace. For example, the following will create and (locally) sign a transfer (type 0) transaction, and then broadcast it to the Lisk Testnet.

```js
const transaction = lisk.transaction.transfer({
	amount: '123000000',
	recipientId: '12668885769632475474L',
	passphrase:
		'robust swift grocery peasant forget share enable convince deputy road keep cheap',
});

const client = lisk.APIClient.createTestnetAPIClient();

client.transactions
	.broadcast(transaction)
	.then(console.info)
	.catch(console.error);
```

## FAQ

Installation is failing, what should I do?

```
Make sure you are installing in the root folder, not on the package level.
Run `npm run clean` and `npm run clean:node_modules`, then install again.
```

I can't build the package, what should I do?

```
Make sure you first run `npm i`, and then `npm run build` in the root directory.
```

Tests are failing!

```
Make sure you are using the correct version of node and npm.
In our current build we recommend node v8.12.0 and npm v6.4.1.
